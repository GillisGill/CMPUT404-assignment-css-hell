            <figcaption>Near my tenth birthday I got my first pc. I was immediately overwhelmed and enamored by the possibilities. So much in fact, that three years later I built my own pc. 
                        I began writing simple scripts and then basic mods for videogames. Eventually, 
                        I found myself wanting a life long career in computers, and while initially I was more interested in hardware, throughout university I found a preference for software.

        <h2> My History</h2>
        <p1></p1>
        <p>
            <strong>Software Development Intern at Click Car Canada</strong> (05/2019 â€“ 09/2019) <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Rapidly prototyped a mobile app to provide
                    users the same ease of access to forms and
                    information available on the Click Car website
                    through their mobile devices</li>
                <li>Used MongoDB to store and organize user
                    information, and allowed for automated
                    emailing to inform team members of user
                    requests.</li>
                <li>Added a Facebook pixel to the existing Click
                    Car website to track user interactions
                    through Facebook, and worked with the team
                    to optimize those interactions</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>What I Have to Offer</h3>
        <p>I have a familiarity with C/C++, java, python, JavaScript, CUDA, Assembly, SQL, Prolog, lisp, Firebase, GIT/github, Django, MongoDB, Android Studio, CNET, 
            and GCP. I have experience working in a group development environment, and have come to learn the soft skills that are almost, 
            if not just as important as coding ability. The necessity of communication, the importance of collaboration, empathy, and conflict management.
        </p>
